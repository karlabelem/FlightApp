1.) I don't exactly remember how many hours I've spent on M2, but it was a lot! I want to say about 20-25 hours because I used two extra late days which added time.
2.) As cheesy as it sounds I feel like almost all the hours I've spent on this project was valuable, especially the debugging and writing test cases parts as annoying as they were. It helps me become a better programmer :)
